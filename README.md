# Information

Scrapers within this repo are a little bit unconventional and primitive. I used Jupyter Notebook Python environment to utilize Selenium Webdriver. I scraped in a semi-supervised manner and interactively with Jupyter Notebooks.

Even little changes in XPATHs can break scrapers let alone complete overhauls on target web sites. Considering websites are changed frequently, everything in this repo is bound to be broken if not maintained. If I ever need to scrape websites on existing directories I might update the code but for now development is halted.

**You can find more information about scrapers on their respective directories.**
